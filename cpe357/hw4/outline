HW 4 Decomposition

Functions
   - sfind recursive function: recursively performs specified function for all files processed
   - process the files; go through the heirarchy (if it's a directory) and process files - fork to do this
      - if substring flag is included, only process files that include substring
      - don't follow . or .. or symbolic links
   - print function: if print is included in the command, print pathname of processed file to stdout
   - fork to new process if -exec action is specified and execute command
      - also need to parse and import command
   - use opendir and readdir
   - cannot use library routines to do traversal; ie scandir or fts functions
   - cannot use system library routine; must write own process creation and program execution code

Errors/resource management
   - be careful of running out of file descriptors
   - prevent program from reaching process limit
