Homework 3 Decomposition

RULE
   - determine types of dependencies
      - target; apply the rule
      - file
      - none (error)
   - check if dependency is updated
      - if file, compare timestamp to target's
      - if target, consider updated because you applied rule^
   - execute rule
      - if no dependencies
      - file with a name matching target doesn't exist
      - any dependencies were updated
   - if command line argument supplied, rule with target = argument is applied
      - if no argument, first line of Smakefile is applied

- every time command is executed, echo it to the screen

ERRORS
   - if rule missing separator
   - if dependency is nonexistent
   - lines not starting with tab aren't rules
   - blank lines are ignored
   - if file cannot be opened then program terminates with an error
   - if no matching rule for command line argument, return error
   - if executed command fails, print error

data structures/functions
   - parse command line arguments
   - error function with switch statements of error codes
   - check timestamp function
   - use tree data structure?

to test
   - errors: system test, execute program improperly to see if errors work
   - timestaps: update timestamps and check if program responds correctly
   - command echo: test command echo by echoing command
