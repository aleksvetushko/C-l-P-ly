Homework 2 Decomposition\
\
1. Start the program (assuming no db)\
	- if there is no qa.db, create one and tell user you are making a new one. \
		- need to first allocate space for it (maybe 1000 bytes?)\
		- the qa.db database is a file a bunch of lines, each line is a string\
		- so strings are delimited by new lines\
		- string tree is ordered in preorder traversal (root, left, right)\
		- children that are null are empty strings\
	- if creating new qa.db, ask user \'93what is it?\'94 and after they answer, end the program\
		- answer is stored in database as root node\
\
2. Start the program (assuming db)\
	- Ask root node question\
		- if no question, ask \'93is it %\'94, whatever animal is in the database\
			- if they say yes, print thanks message and end program\
			- if no, ask what is it\
			- what is a question distinguishing it from the animal you have\
			- what is the answer to that question\
			- tell them i\'92ll get it next time, end program\
		- if there is a question, ask the question\
	- if answer to question is yes, go to child nodes and ask that\
	- repeat above steps if no question\
\
- after every run of the program, free all the memory you\'92ve used\
- also fclose the file\
\
Other Errors\
	- if at any time user just hits enter with no other input, repeat question\
	- if file is corrupted, tell user to fix file and exit program\
		- to tell, when getting child node, if child is empty but has children, file is corrupt\
	- every time we try to use memory that we don\'92t have, allocate more\
\
example file formal:\
\
can it swim?\
no\
yes\
is it a zebra?\
\
System Tests\
	- test program by looking at the database to make sure \'93nodes\'94 are in the right place\
	- test program by playing the game, writing giant answers/questions that are 10000 chars long\
	- try no input, just new line\
	- try corrupting the file and playing (adding a line, removing)\
\
Functions\
	- string fetch(int index, int answer)\
		- fetches string at 2*index + answer\
		- test by fetching strings and comparing them to the right answer\
		- test by entering no input\
	- void create_db()\
		- creates new database\
		- test by creating a new database}
